# Swiss_covid_Re

R scripts and data for estimating the reproductive number for the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. The reproductive number through time is estimated using EpiEstim. The estimateRe_website.R script leads to results as shown in the plot on this webpage: https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/research/sars-cov-2/real-time-monitoring-in-switzerland.html

The confirmed case data is from https://github.com/openZH/covid_19 maintained by the Specialist Unit for Open Government Data Canton of Zurich. We access the data via the repository by Daniel Probst https://github.com/daenuprobst/covid19-cases-switzerland/.

Details of the study and the results as of March 31, 2020, are published in [Swiss Medical Weekly](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).
